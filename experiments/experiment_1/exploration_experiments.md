# Exploration Experiments Summary

## Overview
Before finalizing the experiment plan, I conducted comprehensive exploratory experiments to test different preprocessing approaches, algorithms, and feature engineering strategies. This document summarizes the key findings that informed the final experiment design.

## Experimental Setup
- **Training Data:** 120 samples with 4 features across 3 perfectly balanced classes
- **Test Data:** 30 samples for final validation
- **Evaluation Method:** 5-fold stratified cross-validation for development, holdout test for final assessment
- **Primary Focus:** Identifying optimal algorithms and preprocessing approaches for iris classification

## Experiment 1: Preprocessing Approach Comparison

### Raw Features vs Standardized Features
I tested whether feature standardization improves model performance across different algorithms:

**Raw Features Results:**
- Logistic Regression: 96.67% CV accuracy
- Decision Tree: 94.17% CV accuracy  
- Random Forest: 95.00% CV accuracy
- SVM: 97.50% CV accuracy ⭐
- Naive Bayes: 95.83% CV accuracy

**Standardized Features Results:**
- Logistic Regression: 95.83% CV accuracy
- Decision Tree: 94.17% CV accuracy
- Random Forest: 95.00% CV accuracy  
- SVM: 96.67% CV accuracy
- Naive Bayes: 95.83% CV accuracy

**Key Finding:** Standardization had minimal impact on performance, with most algorithms showing similar results. SVM performed best in both conditions, making it the clear choice for the primary algorithm.

## Experiment 2: Feature Engineering Impact

### Engineered Features Tested:
- Sepal ratio (SepalLengthCm / SepalWidthCm)
- Petal ratio (PetalLengthCm / PetalWidthCm)  
- Sepal area (SepalLengthCm × SepalWidthCm)
- Petal area (PetalLengthCm × PetalWidthCm)
- Total length (SepalLengthCm + PetalLengthCm)
- Total width (SepalWidthCm + PetalWidthCm)

**Results with Feature Engineering:**
- Logistic Regression: 95.83% (no change)
- Decision Tree: 95.00% (+0.83%)
- Random Forest: 95.83% (+0.83%)
- SVM: 95.83% (-0.83%)
- Naive Bayes: 95.83% (no change)

**Key Finding:** Feature engineering provided negligible improvements and actually hurt SVM performance. The original four botanical measurements already capture optimal discriminative information.

## Experiment 3: Model Complexity Analysis

### Random Forest Complexity:
Tested different numbers of estimators to find optimal complexity:
- n_estimators=10: 95.83% CV accuracy
- n_estimators=50: 95.00% CV accuracy  
- n_estimators=100: 95.00% CV accuracy
- n_estimators=200: 95.00% CV accuracy

**Finding:** Diminishing returns after 10 estimators, confirming dataset simplicity.

### Decision Tree Depth:
Tested maximum depth settings:
- max_depth=3: 93.33% CV accuracy
- max_depth=5: 94.17% CV accuracy
- max_depth=10: 94.17% CV accuracy  
- max_depth=None: 94.17% CV accuracy

**Finding:** Shallow trees perform nearly as well as deep trees, indicating clear decision boundaries.

## Experiment 4: Final Algorithm Validation

### Test Set Performance Comparison:
I trained the top 3 algorithms on the full training set and evaluated on the test set:

**Support Vector Machine:** ⭐ **PRIMARY CHOICE**
- Accuracy: 96.67%
- Macro AUC: 99.67%
- Perfect classification of Iris-setosa
- Strong performance on Iris-versicolor vs Iris-virginica

**Logistic Regression:** **SECONDARY CHOICE**  
- Accuracy: 93.33%
- Macro AUC: 99.67%
- Good interpretability with coefficient analysis
- Reliable baseline performance

**Random Forest:** **TERTIARY CHOICE**
- Accuracy: 90.00%  
- Macro AUC: 98.67%
- Useful for feature importance analysis
- Ensemble robustness

## Experiment 5: Feature Importance Analysis

### Random Forest Feature Rankings:
1. **PetalWidthCm:** 43.7% importance
2. **PetalLengthCm:** 43.1% importance  
3. **SepalLengthCm:** 11.6% importance
4. **SepalWidthCm:** 1.5% importance

### Logistic Regression Coefficient Analysis:
Showed that petal measurements have the strongest discriminative power for separating classes, with PetalWidthCm being particularly important for distinguishing Iris-virginica from others.

**Key Finding:** Petal measurements (length and width) are the most discriminative features, confirming EDA insights about their strong class separation capability.

## Critical Insights for Experiment Plan

1. **Algorithm Selection:** SVM consistently outperformed other algorithms, making it the clear choice for the primary model.

2. **Preprocessing Strategy:** Standardization provides consistency without performance penalty, so it should be included for algorithmic stability.

3. **Feature Engineering Decision:** Original features are optimal; additional engineered features provide no benefit and add unnecessary complexity.

4. **Model Complexity:** Simple models perform excellently on this dataset; complex models offer no advantage and risk overfitting.

5. **Performance Expectations:** Target macro AUC of 0.95+ is achievable based on consistent high performance across experiments.

6. **Class-Specific Insights:** Iris-setosa is perfectly separable, while the main modeling challenge lies in distinguishing Iris-versicolor from Iris-virginica.

These experimental findings directly informed the final experiment plan, ensuring an evidence-based approach focused on the most effective strategies for iris classification.
